.SYNOPSIS
    Creates editor-level calendar permissions between all licensed users in Microsoft 365 using Microsoft Graph.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script builds a fully-connected calendar permission mesh by granting each licensed mailbox user "Editor" access 
    to every other licensed user's primary calendar. It uses Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and supports validation 
    to ensure each user has the expected number of permissions.
